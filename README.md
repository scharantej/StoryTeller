**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html**:
   - This HTML file serves as the starting point for the interactive story experience.
   - It contains an introductory section that presents the premise and setting of the story.
   - It includes a list of options for the user's first choice, which will determine the initial direction of the narrative.
   - These options can be presented using elements like buttons or links, and they should have unique identifiers for easy referencing in the Flask routes.

2. **story.html**:
   - This HTML file is used to dynamically present the unfolding story based on the user's choices.
   - It contains a central section for displaying the current chapter of the story and the consequences of the previous choices made by the user.
   - Similar to 'index.html', it includes a list of options for the user's next choice, with unique identifiers for integration with the Flask routes.

**Routes:**

1. **Homepage Route**:
   - This route is associated with the 'index.html' file and serves as the entry point for the interactive story.
   - It handles the display of the initial story introduction and the options for the user's first choice.

2. **Story Progression Route**:
   - This route is connected to the 'story.html' file and manages the progression of the story based on the user's choices.
   - It takes the user's input from the previous chapter (e.g., via form submission) and dynamically generates the next chapter of the story.
   - It also includes the options for the user's continued choices, leading to different narrative paths.

3. **Endings Route**:
   - This route handles the presentation of the story's endings based on the cumulative choices made by the user throughout the narrative.
   - It displays the final outcome or resolution of the story, providing closure to the interactive experience.
